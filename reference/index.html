				<h1>Reference</h1>

				<h2>Species</h2>
				<p>As time goes on, species evolve and become more advanced.</p>
				<table class="table">
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Species</th>
							<th>Description</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>Prokaryotes</td>
							<td>
								An extremely simple, primitive life form.
								There's not much special stuff about it.
								It doesn't use DNA, just RNA.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Archaea</td>
							<td>
								Like Prokaryotes, but with DNA and stuff.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Eukaryokes</td>
							<td>
								These are quite advanced.
								Their creation had to do with bacteria eating each other,
								providing each other as an energy source, growth, mitochondria,
								and other weird stuff.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Algae</td>
							<td>
								Yay! Eukaryotes have learned to work together to be more advanced.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Reptiles</td>
							<td>
								Dinosaurs and stuff like that. And fish. And stuff. I dunno.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Mammals</td>
							<td>
								Warm-blooded and stuff. And hair. Smarter. I think.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Monkeys</td>
							<td>
								Very very primitive human-like mammals.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Cavemen</td>
							<td>
								Primitive humans.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Humans</td>
							<td>
								We're already getting close to the next stage.
								Singularity shoud be complete by 2045, according to Ray Kurzweil.
								We're finally getting somewhere.
								We're going to soon reach Type I on the Kardashev scale.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>---</td>
							<td>
								Border between real and fiction,
								although things like AI could actually become true.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>AI</td>
							<td>
								Unfortunately, these things could replace us. Like, by 2050 or something.
								At least they can reach Type II on the Kardashev scale.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Energy</td>
							<td>
								AI get impatient with the speed of light,
								and maximize energy in this universe by creating
								"Smart" collections of particles and energy that can produce wormholes and stuff.
								With this, the AI's Energy stage can easily reach Type III and Type IV
								on the Kardashev scale.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Creators</td>
							<td>
								Transcending our own universe, the Creators reach Type V on the Kardashev scale.
								At this point, they can manipulate everything in each universe.
								At this stage, they cannot yet reach outside of our multiverse,
								to access universes with different sets of physics.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Corruptors</td>
							<td>
								At this point, Creators become so fed up with the inability to advance
								to the next multiverse that they begin to destory everything.
								They destroy inconcieveable amounts of universes in search of the perfect
								universe, that contains the gateway past our own multiverse.
								When they reach this gate, they will become a Type VI civilization.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Protectors</td>
							<td>
								When they reach the gate, the Corruptors realize the damage
								they have done to their own multiverse.
								When they see this, they vow to not let anymore beings destroy
								as much as they did, to stop rogue civilizations.
								Now a Type VII civilization, the Protectors can begin to span across
								the multiverses to stop other civilizations that became like the Corruptors.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Infinities</td>
							<td>
								Now spanning all of time and space, within all of the multiverses, the Protectors
								have reached a state of peace.
								The Protectors incorporate themselves as part of the omniverse,
								and become infinite.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Seers</td>
							<td>
								With infinite power, the Infinities create and find new omniverses.
								They attempt to grow their power to find the perfect omniverse,
								to reach beyond, into new dimensions.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Shifters</td>
							<td>
								Finding the perfect omniverse, the Seers begin to ascend to an infinite state.
								They exist as a void, an infinity, energy, matter, everything.
								In the perfect omniverse, they find the gate to shift into
								higher dimensions.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Keepers</td>
							<td>
								The Shifters conquer all of the dimensions.
								At this state of being, they have truly infinite power.
								They can conceptualize everything.
								They do not conceptualize, they do.
								Now as Keepers, they maintain the peace and balance of everything.
